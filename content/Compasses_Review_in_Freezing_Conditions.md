Summary: Compasses can also get cold...

I bought the SILVA Ranger Global compass in 2018 and used it intensively in both the southern and northern hemisphere. This model is more expensive because it is designed to work in all magnetic zones. However, the needle is stuck in cold temperature. The specification does not include operating temperature range.

The Suunto Clipper is working okay-ish below zero even though the capsule is full of liquid. The specification includes the operating range: -30° C to +60° C. Notice that the Clipper does not really stay attached to a watertight map case and hard to find when it falls into deep snow. So make sure it is glued and carry a backup compass. Curiously, I had a bubble disturbing the needle motion when using the compass below zero and that bubble disappeared when going back to ambient temperature.
