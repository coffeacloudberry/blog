Summary: My meaning of hiking

I go tramping for a purpose:  
To have an adrenaline dose,  
To go beyond my limit  
And discover the infinite.  
My name is pointless;  
Fame is meaningless.  
It’s all about nature,  
living real adventure,  
and bring back stories  
about my discoveries.  
Wilderness is priceless  
But success has a price.  
It won’t gonna be nice  
Everyday, I expect mess  
To happen on my quest.  
I guess that’s a rough test  
With a slight guess  
of my way to happiness.  
Feel like a mice in a maze  
With skin in the game.  
I stare at Nature in amaze,  
and I don’t feel the same.
